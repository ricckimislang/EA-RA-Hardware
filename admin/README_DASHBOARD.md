# EA-RA Hardware Dashboard Implementation

This directory contains the implementation of the EA-RA Hardware dashboard, providing visualizations for:
- Sales trend analysis
- Expense category tracking
- Employee salary performance
- Product sales analysis
- Inventory status monitoring

## Setup Instructions

1. Import the database schemas (if not already done):
   ```sql
   mysql -u username -p databasename < ../database/expense_schema.sql
   mysql -u username -p databasename < ../database/inventory_schema.sql
   mysql -u username -p databasename < ../database/payroll_schema.sql
   mysql -u username -p databasename < ../database/sales_schema.sql
   ```

2. Import sample data for testing (optional):
   ```sql
   mysql -u username -p databasename < ../database/sample_data.sql
   ```

3. Ensure the dashboard API endpoint is accessible:
   - `/admin/pages/api/dashboard_data.php`
   - This API accepts a `timeRange` parameter with values: `today`, `week`, `month`, `year`
